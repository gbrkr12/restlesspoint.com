Her's a list of things one might gift to a minimalist as a present:

1. **iTunes Gift Card** - one of the best gifts so far. You can buy lot of different virtual goods for it - books, music, audiobooks, apps and even rent a movie. **_But be aware:_** _You should check what store country the person is using, because the Euro card is not compatible with US iTunes store, as example._
2. **Amazon gift certificate** - Kind of similar product to the above, you can buy books, audiobooks, and also real stuff. Same warning applies - know what store the person is using (.com or .co.uk for example)
3. **Ticket**. To a movie, or a concert. Or museum. Something he/she can enjoy.
4. **Restaurant gift certificate**
5. **Spa or Massage gift certificate**
6. **A ticket to activity or new experience** like karting,  kayaking, bowling, etc.
7. **A day travel ticket** like a day trip to other city
8. **Food**. A minimalist would prefer some consumables over stuff. An Apple pie or a bottle of wine as example.
9. **Nothing**. A smile would be enought :)

Any better ideas?
