## Description

Have you ever sat at your desk, fidgeting in front of a clock that repetitively says, "no, not yet"? We all have. Restless Point takes us away from our computers and even comfortable apartments to new places around the globe. We'll tell you where to go and how to do it.

          He's an IT-problem solver and adrenaline junky. Skydiving, scuba diving, sailing, motorcycling and off-road racing are just someways he gets away from his programming screen. For Taras, it is not just where you explore, but how and with what equipment.
