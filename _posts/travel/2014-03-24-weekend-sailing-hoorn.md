Once again we did a weekend sailing trip. 

## The route
This time we did a circle - we went out from Enkhuizen on saturday morning, went thru the lock to Markemeer lake and headed towards Volendam. But the wind was not helping us, so the decision was made to turn to Hoorn, the city I enjoyed the most. Later on, our jorney continued to Lelystaad, thru the lock, and in a small marina for a night. 

Next day, we sailed to a restaurant in a middle of nowhere

## Hoorn

A beautiful small city. It remind me [Bruges](http://restlesspoint.com/travel/bruges/) a bit. It hac a nice city center with an old cute houses.

And a bunch of churches.

A nice walking street with a cozy restaurants and caffes:

## Lelystaad

It was quite fast sailing from Hoorn but as soon as we passed the lock in Lelystaad it came dark. So we went into a nearest small marina and parked just in front of a restaurant.

After having an awesome dinner, crew went playing cards:

## Checkpoint Charlie

[<i class="fa fa-foursquare"></i>](https://foursquare.com/v/checkpoint-charlie/4c46afbac047be9a714e2e79) A tiny restaurant / marina in a middle of nowhere. To be exact - in a middle of a dike that cuts Ijsselmeer and Markemeer lakes. After having a cacao and some rest, the sun came out, so crew made some photos on a boat :)

## Urk
I've mentioned Urk in my previous article [Weekend sailing: Enkhuizen, Mademblik, Stavoren and Urk](http://restlesspoint.com/travel/weekend-sailing-enkhuizen-mademblik-stavoren-and-urk/). This time we visited it again to check the church organ music and just to hang around.

## Back to Enkhuizen

It was already night as we saild to Enkhuizen. And a wind direction was not helping at all. The one thing helped me was a nice [Transas map](http://isailor.us) on my iPhone that helped me plan the tacking and avoid the shallow water.

All in all, it was a pleasant 2-day trip, and I hope sailing with a crew more.
