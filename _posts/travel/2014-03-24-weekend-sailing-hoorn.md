Once again we did a weekend sailing trip. 

## The route
This time we did a circle - we went out from Enkhuizen on saturday morning, went thru the lock to Markemeer lake and headed towards Volendam. But the wind was not helping us, so the decision was made to turn to Hoorn, the city I enjoyed the most. Later on, our jorney continued to Lelystaad, thru the lock, and in a small marina for a night. 

Next day, we sailed to a restaurant in a middle of nowhere
